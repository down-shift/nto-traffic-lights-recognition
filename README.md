# Traffic Light Recognition Algorithm

This algorithm could be used to prefict the color of traffic lights.
It is based on Computer Vision -- no Machine Learning algorithms involved (according to the task).

The code is based on the baseline provided by the contest hosts (although significant changes were made).

Overview of files:
- main.py - the color determining algorithm
- eval.py - algorithm evaluation
- helpers.py - additional code provided with the baseline (not used in the algorithm)

Libraries used in the project: opencv-python, numpy, PIL, matplotlib
